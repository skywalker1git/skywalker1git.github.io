Preface: I've been thinking about how we model enzyme kinetics for several years now, and I've been sitting on most of these thoughts for a while. The ideas henceforth stem from discussions that occurred during Dr.  Jay Groves Chem 270 (Advanced Biophysical Chemistry) course. The writing is somewhat formal as I once hoped, and still somewhat do, to publish this work in a more appropriate forum.
