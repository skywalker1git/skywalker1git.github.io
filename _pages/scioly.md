Science Olympiad is a National Middle and High School science competition. Students around the country compete in a variety of events in different fields ranging from Astronomy, to Cell Biology, to engineering events such as Bridge Building.

I competed in Science Olympiad in my final 2 years of high school, and participated in many of the events in the biology and chemistry space (I also dabbled in astrophysics, which was fun). Since graduating, I've been heavily involved in Science Olympiad Invitational Tournaments as an Event Supervisor. My philosophy on Science Olympiad, at least at the invitational level, is this: it doesnt matter whether you win or lose. What matters is if you <strong>learn</strong>. Consequently, as an exam writer I'm often faced with the task of providing sufficiently challenging questions to competitors that they find themselves learning more, while still having a satisfying competitive experience.

The following is a list of exams I have written over the course of the last few years. They are in different formats, mostly because of tournament format changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. My hope in providing these exams here is that students who happen upon this website might find them and take the opportunity to learn something new in a fun, challenging way.

If you are currently involved in Science Olympiad in any capacity (student, parent, coach, event supervisor, tournament director), feel free to reach out! Also, if you have any questions, comments, or concerns about questions on these exams, please drop me a note!
