I really dig teaching. Not really sure why, but it makes me feel kinda in my element. Sharing knowledge is dope. (As an aside, more people should share their knowledge with me :))

I've been teaching in both official and unofficial capacities for the past few years. I was a Graduate Student Instructor for [Physics 7A](https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/physics/) in Fall '21 and Spring '22. I won the [Outstanding GSI Award](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/) from the Physics department, as well as the selective [Teaching Effectiveness Award](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/teaching-effectiveness/) from the university.

I'm now a GSI for [Physics C10](https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/physics/).
