Hi! Thanks for visiting my website! I'm Sameer, a recent graduate from UC Berkeley. For a while now, I have been interested in applying fundamental physics to biological systems, both to further our understanding of biology and to advance clinical practice. I'm current pursuing this interest by working on deciphering neurophysiological biomarkers of unhealthy cognitive states in patients suffering psychiatric illnesses.

These days, I live in Texas, but at Berkeley I studied Molecular and Cell Biology, minored in physics, and spent a while reading, writing, and learning about the frontiers in Neurotechnology. In my spare time, I find myself going on nature hikes, playing Ultimate Frisbee, hanging out with friends, and hunting around on Reddit.
